{"instruction": "What should I check if my hydraulic pump is making unusual noise?", "input": "", "output": "If your hydraulic pump is making unusual noise, perform this diagnostic sequence:\n\n1. **Identify the noise type:**\n   - Whining/whistling: Likely cavitation or air in system\n   - Knocking/banging: Possible mechanical damage or loose mounting\n   - Grinding: Bearing failure or contamination\n\n2. **Check hydraulic fluid level:**\n   - Low fluid causes cavitation and pump damage\n   - Check reservoir, top up if needed\n   - Look for leaks in suction line\n\n3. **Inspect suction strainer:**\n   - Clogged strainer restricts flow\n   - Remove and clean or replace\n   - Check differential pressure gauge if equipped\n\n4. **Examine coupling alignment:**\n   - Misalignment causes vibration and noise\n   - Use dial indicator to check\n   - Realign if offset >0.005 inches\n\n5. **Check for air ingestion:**\n   - Bubbles in reservoir indicate air entry\n   - Inspect all suction-side connections\n   - Tighten fittings, replace damaged seals\n\n6. **Monitor operating temperature:**\n   - Overheating (>180°F) accelerates wear\n   - Check for adequate flow and cooling\n\n**SAFETY**: De-energize and lockout system before inspection.

{"instruction": "Explain the purpose and operation of a lockout/tagout (LOTO) system", "input": "", "output": "**Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) System - Purpose and Operation**\n\n**Purpose:**\nLockout/tagout is a safety procedure ensuring dangerous equipment is properly shut off and cannot be restarted during maintenance or servicing. It protects workers from unexpected energization, startup, or release of stored energy.\n\n**When LOTO is Required:**\n- Servicing or maintaining equipment where unexpected startup could cause injury\n- Clearing jams or blockages\n- Performing setup, adjustment, or cleaning near hazardous energy sources\n- Any work requiring removal or bypass of safety guards\n\n**Types of Energy to Control:**\n1. **Electrical** - Main power supply, control circuits, capacitors\n2. **Mechanical** - Springs, elevated parts, rotating components\n3. **Hydraulic** - Pressurized fluid systems\n4. **Pneumatic** - Compressed air\n5. **Chemical** - Hazardous materials\n6. **Thermal** - Hot surfaces, steam\n7. **Potential** - Gravity (suspended loads)\n\n**LOTO Procedure:**\n\n**1. Preparation**\n- Identify all energy sources for the equipment\n- Review equipment-specific LOTO procedure\n- Notify all affected personnel\n- Gather necessary locks, tags, and tools\n\n**2. Shutdown**\n- Use normal stopping procedure\n- Do NOT bypass safety interlocks\n- Ensure equipment is at rest\n\n**3. Isolation**\n- Disconnect or isolate all energy sources\n- Examples:\n  - Open electrical disconnects\n  - Close valves\n  - Block mechanical motion\n  - Bleed pressure from hydraulic/pneumatic systems\n\n**4. Lockout/Tagout Application**\n- Apply lock to energy isolation device\n- Each worker applies their own lock (never remove another's lock)\n- Attach tag indicating:\n  - Worker's name\n  - Date and time\n  - Reason for lockout\n  - Contact information\n\n**5. Stored Energy Release**\n- Discharge capacitors\n- Release or block springs\n- Vent pressurized systems\n- Cool hot equipment\n- Lower suspended loads\n\n**6. Verification**\n- Attempt to start equipment (should not operate)\n- Use test instruments to verify zero energy\n- Verify all controls are in \"off\" or \"neutral\"\n\n**7. Perform Work**\n- Equipment is now safe for maintenance\n- Keep locks in place for entire duration\n- Re-verify zero energy if work is interrupted\n\n**8. Restoration**\n- Remove tools and materials\n- Reinstall guards and safety devices\n- Ensure all personnel are clear\n- Remove locks and tags (only by person who installed them)\n- Restore energy and test equipment operation\n\n**Key Safety Points:**\n- One lock per person - NEVER share locks\n- Never remove another worker's lock\n- If you applied a lock, you must remove it\n- If lock owner is unavailable, follow company-specific procedure (usually requires supervisor authorization)\n- Use standardized locks and tags (red is common)\n- Conduct periodic LOTO audits\n\n**Group Lockout:**\nWhen multiple workers are involved:\n- Use lockbox system: All workers' locks on box containing equipment keys\n- Or: Hasp allowing multiple locks on single isolation point\n- Each worker responsible for their own lock\n\n**Penalties:**\nViolating LOTO procedures can result in:\n- Disciplinary action up to termination\n- OSHA citations and fines for employer\n- Criminal charges if injury or death occurs\n\n**Remember:** Lockout/tagout saves lives. Never take shortcuts. If unsure, ask a supervisor.", "source": "safety_training_manual", "type": "safety"}
